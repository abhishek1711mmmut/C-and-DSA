What is low level language?
closer to hardware as compared to high-level languages instead of software. They provide little or no abstraction from the machine instructions and that's why they allow programmers to manipulate hardware elements like register, memory etc. Low-level languages are often used for designing systems, such as developing operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems.

What is high level language?
